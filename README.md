# Alternating Series Explained

Some Manim animation codebase serving mathematical purpose

## Background

My teacher's request was for students to make some
videos about college maths. I did so mainly for credits.

I had to say, this animation is made in Mandarin. 
If you don't like Mandarin, just quit.

## Building

To get started in running my code of state of the art,
install Manim

```shell
pip install manim
```

In case you haven't installed the most powerful program, ffmpeg
```shell
brew install ffmpeg
# or
pacman -S ffmpeg
# or you are not using a modern operating system
```

Meanwhile, a LaTex renderer is supposed to be present
```shell
brew install --cask mactex
```

Now get running
```shell
manim -pqh alternating_series_visual.py
```
